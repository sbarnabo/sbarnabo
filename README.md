- 🌱 I’m currently learning constantly.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The first computer virus, called "Creeper," was created in the early 1970s as an experiment. It wasn't malicious; instead, it was designed to move between computers on ARPANET (the predecessor to the internet) and display the message: "I'm the creeper, catch me if you can!"

To combat Creeper, a program called "Reaper" was created, which is often considered the first antivirus software! So in a sense, the battle between viruses and antivirus software began before modern cybersecurity even existed!
